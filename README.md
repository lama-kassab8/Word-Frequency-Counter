# Word Frequency Counter

A simple Python program that takes a block of text as input and identifies the frequency of all repeated words in it. It removes punctuation, handles case sensitivity, and prints the count for each word that appears more than once.

## How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter text.
2. Splits the text into individual words.
3. Converts all words to lowercase for consistency.
4. Removes punctuation from each word.
5. Counts how many times each word appears.
6. Displays all words that are repeated, along with their frequency.
